As the process {\it 1-2} is isentropic (Fig. \ref{Example01_01:Pic1}), $s_{1}=s_{2}$ and using the data in Table \ref{Example01_01:Table1},
\begin{eqnarray}
&& 6.9917 = s_{f,2}+x_{2}s_{fg,2} = 0.5926 + 7.6361 x_{2} \;\; \Longrightarrow \;\; x_{2}= 0.838 \nonumber \\

The net work $\left(W_{\text{net}}\right)$ is calculated from, $W_{\text{net}}=W_{\text{turbine}}-W_{\text{pump}}$. The work required by the pump is
\begin{eqnarray}
&& W_{\text{pump}}=h_{f,4}-h_{f,3}=v_{f,2}\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) = 1.008\times 10^{-3} \left[\frc{m^{3}}{kg}\right] \times (20-0.08) [bar] \times \left[\frc{100\;kJ/kg}{m^{3}.bar/kg}\right] = 2.008\; kJ/kg \nonumber \\
&& h_{f,4} = 2.008+h_{f,2}=175.89\;kJ/kg\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
And the work produced by the tubine is defined as
\begin{displaymath}
W_{\text{turbine}}=h_{1}-h_{2} = 3159.3-2187.68= 971.62 \; kJ/kg
\end{displaymath}

And the net work is
\begin{eqnarray}
&& W_{\text{net}}=W_{\text{turbine}}-W_{\text{pump}} = 971.62-2.008 \nonumber \\
&& \textcolor{red}{W_{\text{net}}=969.61\frc{kJ}{kg}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The efficiency of the cycle is obtained by the relationship $\eta_{\text{cycle}}=\frc{W_{\text{net}}}{Q_{1}}$. The heat added into the boiler $\left(Q_{1}\right)$ is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
Q_{1}=h_{1}-h_{f,4}=3159.3-175.89=2983.41\;kJ/kg
\end{displaymath}
and the efficiency is
\begin{displaymath}
\textcolor{red}{\eta_{\text{cycle}}=\frc{969.61}{2983.41}=0.325\text{ or } 32.5\%}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{example_01_03_a}The {\it Ts} diagrams of the cycle for all three cases can be seen in Fig. \ref{Example01_01:Pic3}, and the original phase states can assigned as 

\begin{tabular}{l l l l}

Enthalpy of the fluid leaving the pump can be calculated as
\begin{displaymath}
h_{2}=h_{1}+W_{\text{in}}
\end{displaymath}

where the pump work can be computed as
\begin{displaymath}
W_{\text{in}}=v_{1}\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)=3.02\;kJ/kg
\end{displaymath}
therefore the fluid's enthalpy is $h_{2}=194.83\;kJ/kg$. The fluid quality at the turbine output is (assuming isentropic process),
\begin{displaymath}
x_{4}=\frc{s_{4}-s_{f}}{s_{fg}}=\frc{6.7450-0.6492}{7.4996}=0.8128
\end{displaymath}
Thus,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& h_{4}=h_{f}+x_{4}h_{fg}=191.81+0.8128\times 2392.1=2136.1\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
&& q_{\text{in}}=h_{3}-h_{2}=3116.1-194.83=2921.3\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
&& q_{\text{out}}=h_{4}-h_{1}=2136.1-191.81=1944.3\;kJ/kg
\end{eqnarray}

and the cycle efficiency is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
\textcolor{blue}{\eta_{\text{(a)}}=1-\frc{q_{\text{out}}}{q_{\text{in}}} = 1 - \frc{1944.3}{2921.3} = 0.334 \text{ or } 33.4\%}
\end{displaymath}

\item \label{example_01_03_b} For this case, phase-states (1) and (2) remain the same whereas the enthapies of (2) and (4) need to be updated

\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
$P_{1}=0.1\;bar$ (saturated liquid) &  $P_{2}=30\;bar$ & $P_{3}=30\;bar$           & $P_{4}=0.1\;bar$ \\
$h_{1}=191.81\;kJ/kg$               &  $s_{2}=s_{1}$   & $T_{3}=873.15\;K$         & $s_{4}=s_{3}$ \\
$v_{1}=1.01\times 10^{-3}\;m^{3}/kg$ &                  & $h_{3}=3682.8\;kJ/kg$     &                 \\
                                    &                 & $s_{3}=7.509\;kJ/(kg.K)$ &                 \\
\end{tabular}

and using the same procedure as Example \ref{example_01_03_a}, $x_{4}=0.915$ and $h_{4}=2380.3\;kJ/kg$. Added and removed heats are
\begin{eqnarray}
&& q_{\text{in}}=h_{3}-h_{2}=3682.8-194.83=3488.0\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
&& q_{\text{out}}=h_{4}-h_{1}=2380.3-191.81=2188.5\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}

and the cycle efficiency is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
\textcolor{blue}{\eta_{\text{(b)}}=1-\frc{q_{\text{out}}}{q_{\text{in}}} = 1 - \frc{2188.5}{3488.0} = 0.373 \text{ or } 37.3\%}
\end{displaymath}

The thermal efficiency increases from 33.4$\%$ to 37.3$\%$ (Table \ref{Example01_01:Table2}) as superheated steam temperature is raised from 623.15 K to 873.15 K with a smaller amount of moisture -- from 18.7$\%$ to 8.5 $\%$ (i.e., steam quality increases from 81.3$\%$ to 91.5$\%$).

\item \label{example_01_03_c} For this case, phase-state (1) remain the same but all other phase-states changes. Enthalpies are determined in a similar way as shown in Example \ref{example_01_03_a}: $h_{2}=206.95\;kJ/kg$, $h_{3}=3583.1\;kJ/kg$ and $h_{4}=2115.3\;kJ/kg$ with steam quality as $x_{4}=0.804$.  Added and removed heats then become
\begin{eqnarray}
&& q_{\text{in}}=h_{3}-h_{2}=3583.1-206.95=3376.2\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
&& q_{\text{out}}=h_{4}-h_{1}=2115.3-191.81=1923.5\;kJ/kg \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}

and the cycle efficiency is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
\textcolor{blue}{\eta_{\text{(c)}}=1-\frc{q_{\text{out}}}{q_{\text{in}}} = 1 - \frc{1923.5}{3376.2} = 0.430 \text{ or } 43.0\%}
\end{displaymath}

\medskip


The thermal efficiency increases from 37.3$\%$ to 43.0 $\%$ as the boiler pressure is raised from 30 to 150 bar with constant turbine inlet temperature, 623.15 K (Table \ref{Example01_01:Table2}).

Steam for the feedwater heater is extracted from the turbine at 350 kPa, and in condensing raises the temperature of the feedwater to within 6 K of its condensation temperature at 350 kPa. If the turbine and pump efficiencies are both 0.78, what is the thermal efficiency of the cycle and what fraction of the steam entering the turbine is extracted for the feedwater heater?}



%\item \label{P:example8_9}{\it A steam power plant operating on a regenerative cycle (Fig. \ref{example8_9}), includes two feedwater heaters. Steam enters the turbine at 6500 kPa and 873.15 K and exhausts at 20 kPa. Steam for the feedwater heaters is extracted from the turbine at pressures such that the feedwater is heated to 463.15 K in two equal increments of temperature rise, with 5 K approaches to the steam-condensation temperature in each feedwater heater. If the turbine and pump efficiencies are both 0.80, what is the thermal efficiency of the cycle and what fraction of the steam entering the turbine is extracted for each feedwater heater? }


%\item \label{P:example8_10}{\it A power plant operating on heat recovered from the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines uses isobutane as the working medium in a modified Rankine cycle in which the upper pressure level is above the critical pressure of isobutane. Thus the isobutane does not undergo a change of phase as it absorbs heat prior to its entry into the turbine. Isobutane vapour is heated at 4800 kPa to 533.15 K, and enters the turbine as a supercritical fluid at these conditions. Isentropic expansion in the turbine produces a superheated vapour at 450 kPa, which is cooled and condensed at constant pressure. The resulting saturated liquid enters the pump for return to the heater. If the power output of the modified Rankine cycle is 1000 kW, what is the isobutane flow rate, the heat-transfer rates in the heater and condenser, and the thermal efficiency of the cycle? The vapour pressure of isobutane is given by
%\begin{displaymath}
%\ln\left(P^{\text{sat}}\right) = 1 - \frc{2606.775}{T+0.918}\;\;\;\text{with}\;\;\;\left[P^{\text{sat}}\right]=\text{kPa}\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\left[T\right]=\text{K}
%\end{displaymath}
%Also, the enthalpy of the liquid flows can be obtained from
%\begin{displaymath}
%\Delta H = C_{p}\Delta T + V\left(1-\beta T\right)\Delta P
%\end{displaymath}

%\item {\it A power plant operating on heat from a geothermal source uses isobutane as the working medium in a Rankine cycle (Fig.\ref{GenericSteamPlant}). Isobutane is heated at 4.8 MPa (a pressure just below its critical pressure) to a temperature of 533.15 K, at which conditions it enters the turbine. Isentropic expansion in the turbine produces superheated vapour at 450 kPa, which is cooled and condensed to saturated liquid and pumped to the heater/boiler. If the flow rate of isobutane is 75 kg/s, what is the power output of the Rankine cycle and what are the heat-transfer rates in the heater/boiler and cooler/condenser? What is the thermal efficiency of the cycle? Repeat these calculations for a cycle in which the turbine and pump each have an efficiency of 80$\%$. The vapour pressure of isobutane is given in Problem \ref{P:example8_9}.}
