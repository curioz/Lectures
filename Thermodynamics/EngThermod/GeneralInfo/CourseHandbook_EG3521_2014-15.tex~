\section{AIMS}
This course aims to provide Mechanical Engineering students with an in-depth treatment of: 1) the applications of thermodynamics to flow processes; 2) the production of power from heat; 3) refrigeration and liquefaction processes. The course also gives a broad introduction to psychrometry with an applications focus on heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

%%%
%%% Section
%%%
\section{DESCRIPTION}
The course begins with a detailed discussion of the production of power from heat which includes: revision of the Carnot-engine cycle and the basic steam power plant, Rankine cycle, modifications of the Rankine cycle to increase efficiency including superheat/re-heat $\&$ feed water heating, steam power plants and internal combustion engines, internal combustion engines including the Otto Engine, the Diesel engine and the gas-turbine engine (Brayton cycle). 
\medskip

Following on from the production of power from heat is a module on refrigeration and liquefaction processes which use power to move heat from low temperature to high temperature, this module includes: the Carnot refrigerator, the vapour-compression cycle, refrigerant choice, absorption refrigeration, Linde and Claude liquefaction processes. 
\medskip

The course continues with applications of thermodynamics to flow processes including: duct flow of compressible fluids in pipes, nozzles and throttling devices, turbines, compression processes including compressors, pumps and ejectors. 
\medskip

The course concludes with a module on psychrometry which includes: basic definitions, wet bulb temperature, adiabatic saturation temperature, humidity data for the air-water system (humidity-temperature chart and humidity-enthalpy diagram), mixing of humid streams and humidification $\&$ dehumidification.

\section{TIMETABLE}
22 one-hour lectures, 10 one-hour tutorials and 3 one-hour laboratories in total. %Detailed times are provided in Table~\ref{table:timetable}.

\section{ASSESSMENT}
1$^{st}$ attempt: 1 three-hour written examination paper (80$\%$) and continuous assessment (20$\%$). 
\medskip

Resit: A three-hour resit paper may be provided for candidates who fail the course at the first attempt. Where a resit paper is offered, the mark reported for the resit will be the better of:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item 100$\%$ of the resit examination mark;
  \item 80$\%$ of the resit examination mark + 20$\%$ of the continuous assessment mark.
\end{enumerate}
\medskip

{\it Notes on Assessment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Candidates who pass the examination at the first attempt but fail to pass the course will be required to pass the resit examination.
\end{itemize}}

\medskip

The continuous assessment will be based on the submission of engineering reports. Detailed information relating to the format of reports will be given during course contact time.
\medskip

Penalties for late or non-submission of in-course work are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For late submission, 1 CGS mark will be deducted for each late day (including weekends);
   \item For non-submission, a CGS mark of 0 will be awarded and may lead to a refusal of a Class Certificate.
\end{enumerate}
If late or non-submission is due to medical or other circumstances out with your control you must submit a medical certificate or other formal evidence to the Engineering School Office as soon as is practicable but no later than the end of Revision Week (42).




%%%
%%% Section

\section{FORMAT OF EXAMINATION}
Candidates must attempt {\bf ALL FIVE} questions. All questions carry 20 marks. Notes:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Candidates are permitted to use the approved calculator only;
\item Candidates are permitted to use psychrometric charts, steam, refrigeration and air thermodynamic tables, which will be made available to them.
\item Steam charts and tables are provided to candidates.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

{\large {\bf PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING}}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item You must not have in your possession at the examination any material other than that expressly permitted by the examiner. Where this is permitted, such material must not be amended, annotated or modified in any way.
\item During the course of the examination, you must not have in your possession or attempt to access any material that could be determined as giving you an advantage in the examination.
\item You must not attempt to communicate with any candidate during the examination, either orally or by passing written material, or by showing material to another candidate, nor must you attempt to view another candidate's work.
\item {\bf Approved Calculators in Examinations:}  {\it Starting in academic year 2014-15, the School of Engineering list of approved calculators for use in examinations will consist of a single calculator, the Casio FX-991 ES PLUS.  So from September 2014 the only calculator that you may take to your desk in an examination is this Casio calculator.  Note that examiners will be aware of the capabilities of the machine and will assume that you are able to operate this calculator in an examination.  All students should ensure that they have such a calculator and that they are familiar with its operation.}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

{\bf Failure to comply with the above will be regarded as cheating and may lead to disciplinary action as indicated in the Academic Quality Handbook \href{http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/quality/}{(http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/quality/)}. 

\medskip

\begin{center}
\href{https://abdn.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/institution/Policies}{https://abdn.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/institution/Policies}.

\section{FEEDBACK}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Students can receive feedback on their progress with the Course on request at the weekly tutorial/feedback sessions.
\item Students are given feedback through formal marking and return of practical reports.
%\item There will be a test exam at the end of the teaching session. The test exam will be marked (but is not part of the continuous assessment) and the test exam paper questions will be discussed in the Revision week.
\item Students requesting feedback on their exam performance should make an appointment within 2 weeks of the publication of the exam results.
\end{enumerate}

\section{STUDENT MONITORING}
Attention is drawn to Registry's guidance on student attendance and monitoring at:
\begin{center}
\href{http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/monitoring}{http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/monitoring}
\end{center}
1.1 of this guidance says that students will be reported as $\lq$at risk' if the following criteria are met. {\it Either}
\begin{itemize}
\item Absence for a continuous period of 10 working days or 25$\%$ of a course (whichever is less) without good cause being reported;
\item {\it or} Absence from two small group teaching sessions for a course without good cause (e.g., tutorial, laboratory class, any other activity where attendance is  expected and can be monitored);
\item {\it or} Failure to submit a piece of summative or a substantial piece of formative in-course assessment for a course, by the stated deadline (eg class test, formative essay).
\end{itemize}
For the purposes of this, course attendance will be monitored at the tutorial and lab sessions and the formative in-course assessment are the lab reports.
