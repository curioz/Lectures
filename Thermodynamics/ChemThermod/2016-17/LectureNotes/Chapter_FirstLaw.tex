     \section{Introduction}\label{Chapter:FirstLaw:Section:Intro}\index{Work}\index{Heat}\index{Energy}
     In Section~\ref{Chapter:Introduction:Section:ThermodAnalysis}, the main elements in the thermodynamic analysis were introduced, namely {\bf open, closed and isolated systems}, {\bf surroundings} and {\bf boundaries}. The concept of {\bf energy}, {\bf work} and {\bf heat}, pivotal entities in the study of thermodynamics systems, were also defined as,
     \begin{description}
        \item[Work] is motion against an opposing force (Eqn.~\ref{Chpt01_Work1});
        \item[Energy] of a system is its capacity to produce work, and; 
        \item[Heat] is the transfer of energy across the boundary caused by a temperature gradient at the boundary \citep{Devoe_Book}.
     \end{description}
     These definitions are based on observations of systems in a macro-scale, and are critical for mass and energy balances necessary for this chapter. ADD MORE TEXT HERE !!

     \section{The Internal Energy}\label{Chapter:FirstLaw:Section:ThermalEnergy}\index{Internal Energy}\index{Energy!Internal|see{Internal Energy}}
     \begin{subequations}
        A system, with a prescribed amount of mass, contains energy in the form of {\bf internal energy} ($U$, inherent in the internal structure), kinetic energy (linked to the motion) and potential energy (associated with external forces acting upon the mass). The total energy, $E$, associated of the system can then be expressed as 
        \begin{displaymath}
            E = \text{Internal} + \text{Kinetic} + \text{Potential} = U + E_{\text{K}} + E_{\text{P}},
        \end{displaymath}
        and the specific energy, $e$, becomes
        \begin{equation}
            e = \frc{E}{m} = u + e_{\text{K}} + e_{\text{P}} = u + \frc{1}{2}v^{2} + gz,\label{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy1}
        \end{equation}
        where the kinetic energy\footnote{Kinetic energy has three components: vibrational (due to the energy associated with vibration of the body), rotational (associated with the rotation motion) and translational (associated with the motion from one spatial coordinate to another).} is assumed to be due to the translational motion (thus vibrational and rotational motion are neglected) and the potential energy to be due to the constant gravitational force. In Eqn.~\ref{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy1}, $u$, $e_{\text{K}}$ and $e_{\text{P}}$ are specific internal, kinetic and potential energies, respectively. Kinetic and potential energy are associated with the physical state and location (spatial coordinates) of the system, and are commonly named {\it mechanical energy}\index{Energy!Mechanical}.  The internal energy is a characteristic of the thermodynamic state of the mass and is often labelled as {\it thermal energy}\index{Energy!Thermal}.
      
       \begin{shaded}
          The internal energy is a {\it state function} as its value depends only on the current state of the system and is independent of processes undertook by the system, \ie it is a function of the properties that determine the current state of the system.
       \end{shaded}

       Let's consider a {\it control volume} with a prescribed mass; an {\it energy balance} can be performed over this control volume assuming that energy can not be created or destroyed but just transformed. Thus, any change in energy must be due to an energy transfer into or out of the control volume, which can be represented as work ($W$) or heat ($Q$) transfers,
      \begin{equation}
        \frc{d\mfr[E]{}{\text{cv}}}{dt} = \mfr[\dot{E}]{}{\text{cv}} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W},\label{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy2}
      \end{equation}
      where the {\it dot} symbol $\left(\dot{ }\right)$ over the variables represents the rate of change, \ie $\frc{d\left[\; \right]}{dt}$. Equation~\ref{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy2} represents the rate of change (\ie {\it instantaneous rate}) of the total energy stored in the control volume, where part of the system's energy can be transferred from or into the surroundings of the control volume. In most cases, we are interested in finite changes of properties from the beginning of the process to its end, rather than instantaneous rate evaluations. In such cases, we just need to integrate the energy equation (Eqn.~\ref{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy2}) \wrt time, \ie from time $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, or we can simply multiply by $dt$,
      \begin{equation}
        \mfr[dE]{}{\text{cv}} = dU + dE_{\text{K}} + d E_{\text{P}} = \delta Q + \delta W,\label{Chapter:FirstLaw:Eqn:TotalEnergy3}\footnote{Here, it is important to differentiate three mathematical symbols commonly used in thermodynamics: $d$, $\delta$, $\partial$. $d$ represents the {\it exact (or total) differential} (see Appendix~\ref{Appendix_Calculus:TotalDifferential}) }
      \end{equation}

       The internal energy of a system may be changed in any of the following ways: producing or receiving work and/or have heat being removed or added to the system. Heat and work are equivalent ways of changing a system's internal energy \citep{Atkins_Book}. It was experimentally observed that in isolated systems there is {\bf no} change in the internal energy.
