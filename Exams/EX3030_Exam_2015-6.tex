\item\label{HE_Exam1} An engineer is designing a new system in which 230 kg/h of water is heated from 35$^{\circ}$C to 93$^{\circ}$C by oil initially at 175$^{\circ}$C. The mass flow rate of oil is also 230 kg/h. Two double-pipe heat exchangers are available:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Heat Exchanger 1: Overall heat transfer coefficient $\left(U_{1}\right)$ of 570 W/$\left(\text{m}^{2}.^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$ with superficial area $\left(A_{1}\right)$ of 0.47 m$^{2}$, and;
   \item Heat Exchanger 2: $U_{2}$ = 370 W/$\left(\text{m}^{2}.^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$ and $A_{2}$ = of 0.94 m$^{2}$.
\end{itemize}
Which exchanger should be used? Why?
Given C$_{p,\text{oil}}$ = 2.10 kJ/$\left(\text{kg.}^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$ and C$_{p,\text{water}}$ = 4.18 kJ/$\left(\text{kg.}^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$

\item\label{Transient_Exam1} A thick concrete wall having a uniform temperature of 54$^{\circ}$C is suddenly subjected to an airstream at 10$^{\circ}$C. The convective heat transfer coefficient is 10 W/$\left(\text{m}^{2}.^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$. Calculate the temperature in the concrete slab at a depth of 7 cm after 30 min. Given the conductive heat transfer coefficient of concrete $\left(\kappa_{\text{concrete}}\right)$ of 1.37 W/$\left(\text{m.}^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$.

\item\label{Transient_Exam2_FDM} Heavy oil at 150$^{\circ}$C is pumped into a storage tank before being transported to distillation columns. The tank is insulated with a layer of polyisocyanurate of 10 cm thick. The tank's wall is at 150$^{\circ}$C and the initial temperature of the insulation layer is 20$^{\circ}$C. Assuming that the problem can be considered as 1-D, calculate the temperature profile of the insulated layer, $T\left(\underline{x},t\right)$, at $t = 2$ seconds with $\underline{x}=\left[0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0\right]$. The outer layer of the insulation material is subjected to the environment with temperature of 15$^{\circ}$C and convective heat transfer coefficient of 10 W/$\left(\text{m}^{2}.^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$. Given for polyisocyanurate insulation layer: (a) conductive heat transfer coefficient: 0.054 W/$\left(\text{m.}^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$; (b) heat capacity at constant pressure: 1 kJ/$\left(\text{kg.}^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$; (c) density: 550 kg/m$^{3}$.

% Holman (10.36)
\item\label{HE_Exam2} A shell-and-tube heat exchanger has condensing steam at 100$^{\circ}$C in the shell side with one shell pass. Two tube passes are used with air in the tubes entering at 10$^{\circ}$C. The total surface area of the heat exchanger is 30 m$^{2}$ and the overall heat transfer coefficient may be taken as 150 W/$\left(\text{m}^{2}.^{\circ}\text{C}\right)$. If the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is 85$\%$, calculate the total heat transfer rate?
